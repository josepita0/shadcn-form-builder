# Form Builder Package

This repository provides a set of components to generate dynamic react forms using some shadcn-ui components as a base.

[![My Skills](https://skillicons.dev/icons?i=react)](https://skillicons.dev)

We use react-hook-form to handle internal form states, and zod to provide validation.

We also built an npm package to be able to use all the components and hooks in this repo, improving form creation times.
